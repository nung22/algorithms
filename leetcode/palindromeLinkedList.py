234. Palindrome Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a 
palindrome or false otherwise.


Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 9


Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
